This project inspects how Market Basket Analysis performs on the MeDAL dataset, a medical abbreviation disambiguation dataset for nat- ural language understanding. We implemented the well known A priori algorithm to discover frequent itemsets and association rules from trans- actional data. The analysis requires some preliminary processing of data, so they will also be object of discussion. And, finally, we understand the reults of the analysis by focusing on three metrics of Market Basket Analysis: support, confidence, and interest.

We implemented the algorithm on a sample equal to 0.001% of the whole dataset. If you wnat to replicate the analysis, we suggest to lower such sample to significantly reduce the running time of the whole algorithm. â€™
