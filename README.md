This project inspects how Market Basket Analysis performs on the MeDAL dataset, a medical abbreviation disambiguation dataset for nat- ural language understanding. We implemented the well known A priori algorithm to discover frequent itemsets and association rules from trans- actional data. The analysis requires some preliminary processing of data, so they will also be object of discussion. And, finally, we understand the results of the analysis by focusing on three metrics of Market Basket Analysis: support, confidence, and interest.
